# Dylan Do amaral's website

This is the repository of my own website made with no that much knowledge about the technologies that are currently leading in this field. As a result, technologies may change over time. My goal is to create a blog and a showcase site that really represents myself without using wordpress.

## Current technologies used (30/10/2019):

### Client side

- :lipstick: Sass: styling processing langage (https://sass-lang.com/)
- :briefcase: Webpack 4: module blunder (https://webpack.js.org/)
- :book: Swup: page transition library (https://swup.js.org/)

### Server side

- None yet :(
